    <h1>Understanding IT Infrastructure and Enterprise</h1>
    <h3>Development, Impact, and Cyber Security Perspective</h3>

    <p>
        In today’s digital era, information technology plays a crucial role in supporting
        organizational activities. One of the most important foundations of modern technology
        systems is IT Infrastructure. IT infrastructure enables enterprises to operate efficiently,
        manage large amounts of data, and deliver digital services to users.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is IT Infrastructure?</h2>
    <p>
        IT Infrastructure refers to the combination of hardware, software, networks,
        data storage, and IT services that support the operation and management of
        information systems within an organization.

            servers, databases, and cloud storage.

    </figure>

    <h2>Development of IT Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>
        The development of IT infrastructure has evolved from traditional on-premise
        systems to cloud-based and hybrid environments. Virtualization and cloud computing
        have enabled organizations to scale resources efficiently while reducing costs.

    </figure>

    <h2>IT Infrastructure in Enterprise Environments</h2>
    <p>
        In enterprise environments, IT infrastructure supports critical systems such as
        ERP, CRM, online banking, e-learning platforms, and e-commerce applications.
        A reliable infrastructure ensures system availability and performance.
    </p>

    <h2>Impact of IT Infrastructure on Cyber Security</h2>
    <p>
        Modern IT infrastructure improves security monitoring and data protection.
        However, it also introduces new challenges, including data breaches,
        ransomware attacks, and cloud security risks.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Improved monitoring and threat detection</li>
        <li>Stronger data encryption and access control</li>
        <li>Increased attack surface</li>
        <li>Dependence on third-party cloud providers</li>
    </ul>

    </figure>

    <h2>Levels of Cyber Security</h2>
    <p>
        Cyber security in IT infrastructure is implemented through multiple layers,
        including physical security, network security, application security, data security,
        and user awareness. This layered defense strategy helps reduce overall risk.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        IT Infrastructure is the backbone of enterprise systems. While technological
        advancements provide efficiency and scalability, they also increase cyber security
        risks. Therefore, enterprises must implement strong and layered security strategies
        to protect data and ensure business continuity.
